Today I am happy, so I want to study AngularJS. I have to say I'm an emotional person, but who cares. OK, let's start right now.

# What's the AngularJs
Let's copy from wiki, AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular.js" or "AngularJS 1.X") is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework mainly maintained by __Google__ and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. The JavaScript components complement Apache Cordova, the framework used for developing __cross-platform mobile apps__. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

# Build AngularJs App
There are two requirements for adding AJ to webpage.
1. Add a &lt;script src="angular.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag pointing to angular.js.
This is the only library angular depend on.
2. Add an ng-app attribute in your HTML.
ng-app is an Angular directive.
The ng is short for Angular.
